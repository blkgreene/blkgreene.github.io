## Cincinatti, OH, USA - May 2023 {.tabset}

### Day 1

Friday, 5 May 2023 GSP -\> PHL -\> CVG Cincinnati

Went out with Sav for her birthday lst night. Paid for it this morning - slept through first alarm, saved by normal weekday alarm. Got really lucky! Skipped breakfast and grabbed a burger in Philly. Bit of a headache and fatigue, but not too bad, considering.

Ride to Cincy went well aside from some turbulence. Never really bothered me in the past, but seems to be getting worse with age. Ryan picked me up and I met his friends Annette and Kevin. Nice people. Picked up race packets then had dinner wit hSam in Hyde Park. Good day overall.

### Day 2

Saturday, 6 May 2023 Cincinnati

Terrible hotel breakfast. I mean wow, those eggs were *bad*. After that we spent the day exploring the city.

First things first, we previewed our walk to the start line for tomorrow morning. It's not bad, about a hile and almost all downhill.

Jumped on the free downtown tram and rode around. Interesting mix of peoples. Hopped off at Findlay Market to explore vendors. Lots of butchers and meat markets, couple bakers, couple coffee shops. Cool place.

Went to Washington Park next, then to the Underground Railroad Museum. Very nice museum focused on many areas of repression and slavery, not just the chattel slavery of early America.

Walked along the river after lunch, then up Mt. Adams. Beautiful old church at top and great show by Sam's band at a Kentucky Derby house party!

Had dinner and went to bed early.

### Day 3 - RACE DAY!

Sunday, 7 May 2023 Cincinnati

Holy fuck, so much rain! And lightning. It was insane. Couldn't have been more wet. Rain coat was useless. Great race, though. Tons of community support.

Ran list \~6 miles with Jen. She kept me going at the end and when I began to struggle. Could barely walk afterwards.

Said goodbye to the Cleveland crew after the race and then had lunch with Eric Antonio. Greate to see him again.

Met up with Sam and spent the afternoon and evening in Hyde Park.

My left foot really hurts - ankle and heel. Hope it gets better quickly. Knees and legs sore, but no worse than expected.

### Day 4

Monday, 8 May 2023 CVG -\> ATL -\> GSP

Didn't do much. Sam and I had lunch at a Mediterranean restaurant, then a beer at Taft before he dropped me off at the airport.

Flights were relaxed. Walked out to my car when I got to GSP, changed out my bags, and prepared for Scottland. Went back into the airport and tried to get some sleep before security opened. Not very much luck in that department.
